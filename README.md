# The Seasoned Schemer Project
Ian Taylor, 2017

[The Seasoned Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/seasoned-schemer) is the sequel to *The Little Schemer*, a classic programming book for the language Scheme.
This repo contains my exercise code and helper code (some of which is mine).
I'm implementing all code using [MIT/GNU Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) on a MacBook Pro.
